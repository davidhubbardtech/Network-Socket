# Network-Socket


This project implements socket programming with the use of a client server network. Run the server file in the terminal and then run the client file so that both are running simultaneously. Enter your name into the client terminal so that the server can receive the request, and display the client's IP address & port number. This program can be run with different devices, but make sure to change the 'localhost' to the actual IP address within the file when doing this.
